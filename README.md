Overview
The School Report Management System is designed to streamline the process of generating and managing student report cards. This system focuses on:

Report Outcomes (RO): High-level outcomes for each subject.
Learning Outcomes (LO): Specific objectives mapped to each Report Outcome.
Assessments: Evaluations for each Learning Outcome that contribute to the overall Report Outcome.
By aligning these elements, the system ensures accurate and meaningful reporting of student performance.

Features
Define Report Outcomes (RO):
Define key objectives for each subject, such as:

Math: "Demonstrates problem-solving skills"
Science: "Applies the scientific method effectively"
Map Learning Outcomes (LO) to RO:
Each RO is broken into smaller, measurable Learning Outcomes. For example:

RO: "Demonstrates problem-solving skills"
LO1: "Solves linear equations with accuracy"
LO2: "Applies arithmetic principles to real-world problems"
Assessments:
Assessments are tied to individual Learning Outcomes and contribute to the overall grade or performance score for the associated Report Outcome.

Report Card Generation:
The system compiles scores from all Assessments and Learning Outcomes to create a detailed report card for each student.

Usage
Set Up Subjects and Outcomes:
Add subjects, Report Outcomes, and their associated Learning Outcomes via the admin interface or configuration files.

Add Assessments:
Create and manage assessments linked to specific Learning Outcomes.

Input Student Data:

Generate Reports:
Generate individual report cards for students, summarizing their performance across all subjects and outcomes.

Example
Sample Data Flow
Subject: Mathematics

Report Outcome:
"Demonstrates problem-solving skills"
Learning Outcomes:
LO1: "Solves linear equations with accuracy"
LO2: "Applies arithmetic principles to real-world problems"
Assessments:
LO1: Test on Linear Equations (Score: 85%)
LO2: Real-world Arithmetic Application Assignment (Score: 90%)
Generated Report Card:

Mathematics:
RO: "Demonstrates problem-solving skills" - 87.5%










The **Student Report System** is designed to manage and track students' progress by evaluating their performance across various subjects. The system generates detailed report cards based on predefined Report Outcomes (RO), Learning Outcomes (LO), and Assessments.

## Features
- **Report Outcomes (RO):** Represents the overall performance criteria for each subject.
- **Learning Outcomes (LO):** Specific goals or skills that students should achieve within a given Report Outcome.
- **Assessments:** Tests, assignments, or other evaluations that measure the achievement of Learning Outcomes.
- **Report Cards:** Generated based on the Learning Outcomes achieved and their corresponding assessments.

## Structure

### 1. **Report Outcomes (RO)**

Report Outcomes are broad categories or overall goals for each subject. These serve as the foundation for tracking a student's performance. Examples of Report Outcomes for subjects may include:

- **Mathematics:**
  - Problem Solving
  - Algebra and Calculus Understanding
  - Geometry and Spatial Awareness
  
- **Science:**
  - Scientific Inquiry
  - Laboratory Skills
  - Data Analysis
  
- **English Language:**
  - Writing Skills
  - Reading Comprehension
  - Oral Communication

### 2. **Learning Outcomes (LO)**

Each Report Outcome (RO) has specific Learning Outcomes (LO) that describe what students need to achieve for a particular goal. These outcomes are used to break down the larger Report Outcome into measurable units. 

For example:

- **Mathematics > Problem Solving**
  - LO1: Solve word problems involving basic arithmetic.
  - LO2: Apply geometric principles to solve practical problems.
  - LO3: Solve real-world problems using algebraic expressions.

- **Science > Scientific Inquiry**
  - LO1: Formulate hypotheses based on observations.
  - LO2: Design experiments to test scientific hypotheses.
  - LO3: Interpret experimental data and draw conclusions.

### 3. **Assessments**

Assessments are the means by which students demonstrate their understanding of the Learning Outcomes. These can include:

- Quizzes
- Assignments
- Practical exams
- Projects
- Presentations

### 4. **Report Card Generation**

The student’s **Report Card** is generated based on the assessments aligned with Learning Outcomes. Once a student completes assessments, their scores are evaluated against the Learning Outcomes for each Report Outcome.

For example:
- If a student achieves 80% in Problem Solving (Mathematics), they might score "Meets Expectations" in that Report Outcome.
- If a student does not meet the Learning Outcome threshold in Scientific Inquiry (Science), their grade for that subject may reflect this.

The report card will include:
- A summary of each subject with Report Outcomes and the associated Learning Outcomes.
- A final grade based on the students’ achievements and assessment results.

## How it Works

1. **Input Data:**
   - Teachers input assessment results for students.
   - Assessments are mapped to specific Learning Outcomes and Report Outcomes.

2. **Assessment Evaluation:**
   - The system evaluates the student's performance in each Learning Outcome.
   - Based on the evaluation, the system assigns a grade or feedback for each Report Outcome.

3. **Generate Report Cards:**
   - The system calculates the final grade for each subject based on the student's Learning Outcomes achievement.
   - A comprehensive report card is generated with detailed insights into the student’s performance.
